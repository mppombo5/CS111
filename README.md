# CS 111 - UCLA, Winter Quarter 2020

This is my repository for my Operating Systems Principles class, taken with [Prof. Harry Xu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/) and TA Shaan Mathur during winter quarter of 2020.

**Disclaimer:** this repository is for professional purposes, so that prospective employers may judge my mastery of relevant materials. You are more than welcome to inspect and analyze it, but any direct usage of my code in your own 111 projects is done without my knowledge and at your own risk.

## Project Scores

At the time of writing, the Projects section of the class website for Winter 2020 can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/courses/111/winter20/ProjectGuide/index.htm).

| Project | Score | Brief Description |
|:-------:|:-----:|-------------------|
| [Proj. 0](Proj0) | 100/100 | A warmup lab to judge how familiar we are with the C language and its libraries, GNU utils, and various POSIX system calls. |
| [Proj. 1A](Proj1/PartA) | 98/100 | A basic client-server application that uses polled I/O to pass and execute shell commands to the server. |
| [Proj. 1B](Proj1/PartB) | 84/100 | An extension of 1A which adds TCP sockets and compressed communication. |
| [Proj. 2A](Proj2/PartA) | 81/100 | A multi-threaded program that handles race conditions in a sorted linked list using the `pthread` library, and produces informational graphs using [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). |
| [Proj. 2B](Proj2/PartB) | 86/100 | An extension of 2A which utilizes various synchronization methods for parallel manipulation of the linked list. |
| [Proj. 3A](Proj3/PartA) | 84/100 | A C++ program that analyzes an EXT2-formatted filesystem image and prints a summary to standard output. |
| [Proj. 3B](Proj3/PartB) | 96/100 | A Python program which analyzes the output from 3A and diagnoses errors in the corresponding filesystem. |
| [Proj. 4A](Proj4/PartA) | 100/100 | Setup for our embedded systems project using a [SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green Wireless](https://beagleboard.org/green-wireless). |
| [Proj. 4B](Proj4/PartB) | 96/100 | Utilizes the BeagleBone and its included sensors to measure and output temperature readings. |
| [Proj. 4C](Proj4/PartC) | 98/100 | An IoT program that builds upon the funcionalities introduced in 4B. Adds communication over TCP as well as an option for communication over TLS using the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library.

## General Submission Format

Each project submission consists of:

- Source files in either C, C++, or Python
- A Makefile with the following targets:
  - default - builds the binaries from the source files
  - dist - builds the deliverable tarball in `.tar.gz` format
  - clean - delete all executables and output generated by the Makefile
- A plaintext README containing contact info and a high-level overview of the project
