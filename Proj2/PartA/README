Q 2.1.1
It takes many iterations to see errors because each thread performs more operations on the pointer with increasing iterations; with more iterations, there are more opportunities for data races. Conversely, with relatively few iterations there are significantly less opportunities for race conditions.

I wrote this script to aid in generating multiple lines of csv output:

#!/bin/bash
i=0
if [[ $# -ne 3 ]]; then
    echo 'Only 3 variables!'
    echo 'how many lines, threads, iterations'
    exit 1
else
    max=$1
    threads=$2
    iters=$3
fi

while [[ $i -lt $max ]]; do
    ./lab2_add -t $threads -i $iters
    i=$(( $i + 1 ))
done

This way, I could just run something like './gencsv 100 2 1000' to generate 100 lines of output running 1000 iterations on 2 threads.
